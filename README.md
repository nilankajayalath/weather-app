ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Project: Weather App!

I recently built a dynamic weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With the help of an API key from OpenWeatherMap, my app fetches real-time weather details for any location. ðŸŽ“ 

Check out the live app here: https://nilankajayalath.github.io/weather-app/

This project helped me further enhance my skills in API integration and web development. Looking forward to creating more! ðŸ’•
